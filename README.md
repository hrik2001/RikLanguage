#Rik Programming Language
This is just a dummy programming language which was and is being being developed by Rik.</br>

#Synopsis
Its just a programming language which i developed just for fun. i was bored and when boredom strikes an idea strikes too. you can kind of consider this a full fledged language except that you cannot write functions and import or include headers or modules, but i will add those features later. I will probably even make this language object oriented

#Motivation
No motivation at all lol, i was lazy and i was developing it as a part of a bigger project, then this branched out and now i am developing it

#Usage
a sample script
 #this is a comment</br>
 ${a}=12</br>
 print ${a} #will print out 12</br>
 ${a}="i am dynamic,since i am string now" </br>
 print ${a} #will print the string
 
 if 1==1:</br>
  print 12</br>
 end
 
 if 2==2:</br>
  print 1</br>
 end</br>
 elif 1==2:</br>
  print 0
 end</br>
 else:</br>
  print 12
  </br>
  while 1:
   print 1
  
  while True: #u can write True instead of 1 too</br>
   print 2

#Credits
i actually made it without any help so no references and thank yous but i will thank Python for their language and their eval() for boolean logics and PEMDAS. i will code a logical function myself later to be completely indepenedent.

#Feedbacks
